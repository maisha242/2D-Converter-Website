## 2D to 3D Converter

The “2D Converter” project aims to transform 2D artifacts and technical drawings into 3D mesh models. The 2D artifacts can take a variety of formats, including: Paper, Mylar, and Soft copy. To convert the existing 2D artifacts, a deep learning solution will be utilized. Alongside that, a GUI mainly used by engineers will be designed and implemented to ingest and visualize artifacts. The application will leverage several AWS technologies to develop a proof of concept of the 2D to 3D mesh generation.
