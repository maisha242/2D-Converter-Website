The 2D artifacts can take a variety of formats, including: Paper, Mylar, and Soft copy. To convert the existing 2D artifacts, a deep learning solution will be utilized. Alongside that, a GUI mainly used by engineers will be designed and implemented to ingest and visualize artifacts. The application will leverage several AWS technologies to develop a proof of concept of the 2D to 3D mesh generation.</p>

<p>This project is currently being worked on by members: <a href="https://github.com/tsf2802">Takumi Fukuzawa</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maisha242">Maisha Iqbal</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sui2435">Sadman Islam</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GlennT18">Glenn Todd</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rhy2781">Robert Yamasaki</a>.</p>
